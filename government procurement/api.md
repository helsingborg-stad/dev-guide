## API (Application Programming Interface)

All interfaces that are implemented should be implemented with either one of the following tech: 

- Restful JSON following the json:api standard [https://jsonapi.org/]. 
- GraphQL following the best practice at [https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/]. 
- Websockets

A SOAP service is not accepted as a viable API (Application Programming Interface). Neither are a simple XML formatted response. 

## API Coverage

API's delivered as a response to a public procurement of Helsingborg Stad should enable developers to perform all actions avabile for a native user of the application in every avabile role.
