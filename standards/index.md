We are commited to make it easy for others to reuse our code. Therefore, all products should be written with the standard for public code. After Januar√Ω 1, 2021. Main products will be adapted to this standard whenever a change is made. 

The Standard for Public Code gives public organizations a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by similar public organizations in other places. It includes guidance for policy makers, city administrators, developers and vendors.
