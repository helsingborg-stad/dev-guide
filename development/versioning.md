# Versioning
We are using [Semver](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,  
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.  
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
